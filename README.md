# Alignement-project
Code for an optimal alignement like Needlemann and Wunsh  

If your using the API, here are the differents options available :
    - fasta = "name of the fasta" : need to be a multifasta that contains the two sequences for the alignement
    - s1 , s2 = "name of the sequence 1 and 2" : if you'r not using a fasta you can just put the name of the two sequences required for the alignement
    - penalire = penality score : the panality score that you want to apply on the alignement, there is no difference between a gap opening and a gap extention
    - fasta_out = "True / False" : if you want to create a fasta with the result of the alignement put this option on True, it will create a fasta named sequence_aligne.fasta
